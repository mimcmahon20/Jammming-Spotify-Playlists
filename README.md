#Jammming Spotify Playlists

ðŸ”´ My first React App I learned about state management, API requests, props, and much more. The app allows users to search for songs, add them to a playlist, add their most listened to songs, and add the playlist to their library. Note: This app requires access to be added in the backend for Spotify's API. If you'd like to try it, reach out!

##Features
ðŸŸ  Allows users to sign in and out of their Spotify accounts through Spotify's API
ðŸŸ¤ Create multiple playlists in the same session 
ðŸŸ¡ Playlist creation is not shown until the user signs in
ðŸŸ¢ Dynamically displays search results as the user types
ðŸ”µ Displays users' all-time most streamed songs and allows them to be added to the playlist
ðŸŸ£ Custom playlist names
